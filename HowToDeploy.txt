/* Packing and deploying: */

    This component is deployed as nuget package for the consuming app. So please follow the below steps to deploy this component, whenever a change has been made.

    1.First Update the major or minor version depends on your change. 
        - Right click on the project, go to properties, and then go to package section.
        - Update the version number under Package Version, Assembly version & Assembly file version.
        - Give some notes about your chage in Release Notes section

    2.Now Publish (right click on the project in VS and click on publish) the app. This will create a Kendo.Component.AdvancedSort.Mvc.Core.1.0.0.nupkg file 
      under '{your project root folder}\WebComponentLibrary\Kendo.Component.AdvancedSort.Mvc.Core\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish' folder

    3.Next step is to use nuget.exe to deploy the package to shared package folder.
      - If you dont have already, please download the nuget.exe from here https://www.nuget.org/downloads
      - Shared package folder for our nuget packages is \\nuget-offline\package\

        Now follow the below steps

        - Open CMD promt in ADMIN mode
        - CD to the location where your nuget.exe file is e.g CD C:\Nuget
        - Run this command 
            'nuget add {your project root folder}\WebComponentLibrary\Kendo.Component.AdvancedSort.Mvc.Core\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish\Kendo.Component.AdvancedSort.Mvc.Core.1.0.0.nupkg -source \\nuget-offline\package\'
          Dont forget to replace {your project root folder} with your folder path.
  
    You have now deployed a new version of nuget package for this project. Go to your consuming app and update the package to this newer version, as you normally do for any other nuget package.

    Important!!! 
    All tsconfig.json files should be excluded from the build output. You can do that by right clicking the tsconfig.json file, going to properties, setting Build Action to None.
